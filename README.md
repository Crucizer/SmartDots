# SmartDots (Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm)

This is implementation of the genetic evolutionary which I tried to follow along with [CodeBullet's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk) where he used processing to do the same. This is still a little buggy but works for the most part. 

The goal of the program is pretty simple, we start out with random dots flying around and they learn to reach the goal (red dot).
